description = """
Nextflow is a workflow system for creating scalable, portable, and reproducible workflows.
It is based on the dataflow programming model, which greatly simplifies the writing of parallel and
distributed pipelines, allowing you to focus on the flow of data and computation.

Nextflow can deploy workflows on a variety of execution platforms, including your local machine,
HPC schedulers, AWS Batch, Azure Batch, Google Cloud Batch, and Kubernetes.
Additionally, it supports many ways to manage your software dependencies,
including Conda, Spack, Docker, Podman, Singularity, and more.

description = """
RAxML (Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood) is a program for sequential and
parallel Maximum Likelihood based inference of large phylogenetic trees. It can
also be used for post-analyses of sets of phylogenetic trees, analyses of
alignments and, evolutionary placement of short reads.

It has originally been derived from fastDNAml which in turn was derived from
Joe Felsenteinâ€™s dnaml which is part of the PHYLIP package.

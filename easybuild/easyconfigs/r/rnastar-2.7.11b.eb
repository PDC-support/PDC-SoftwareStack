description = """
Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) is a fast RNA-seq read
mapper, with support for splice-junction and fusion read detection.

STAR aligns reads by finding the Maximal Mappable Prefix (MMP) hits between
reads (or read pairs) and the genome, using a Suffix Array index. Different
parts of a read can be mapped to different genomic positions, corresponding to
splicing or RNA-fusions. The genome index includes known splice-junctions from
annotated gene models, allowing for sensitive detection of spliced reads. STAR
performs local alignment, automatically soft clipping ends of reads with high
mismatches.

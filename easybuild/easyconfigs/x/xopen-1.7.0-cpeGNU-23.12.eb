description = """
This Python module provides an xopen function that works like Pythonâ€™s built-in
open function but also transparently deals with compressed files. xopen selects
the most efficient method for reading or writing a compressed file.

Supported compression formats are:
 * gzip (.gz)
 * bzip2 (.bz2)
 * xz (.xz)
 * Zstandard (.zst) (optional)

NOTE: This module is ONLY to be used as dependency of other modules. If you are
a user, you should use the module miniconda3 and create your own python environment
instead of loading this module.

compression ratio. LZMA Utils are no longer developed, although critical bugs
may be fixed as long as fixing them doesn't require huge changes to the code.
Users of LZMA Utils should move to XZ Utils. XZ Utils support the legacy .lzma
format used by LZMA Utils, and can also emulate the command line tools of LZMA
Utils. This should make transition from LZMA Utils to XZ Utils relatively
easy."""

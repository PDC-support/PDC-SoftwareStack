description = """
BBMap is a splice-aware global aligner for DNA and RNA sequencing reads.
It can align reads from all major platforms â€“ Illumina, 454, Sanger, Ion Torrent,
Pac Bio, and Nanopore. BBMap is fast and extremely accurate, particularly with
highly mutated genomes or reads with long indels, even whole-gene deletions
over 100kbp long. It has no upper limit to genome size or number of contigs,
and has been successfully used for mapping to an 85 gigabase soil metagenome
with over 200 million contigs. Additionally, the indexing phase is very fast
compared to other aligners.

BBMap has a large array of options, described in its shell script. It can output
many different statistics files, such as an empirical read quality histogram,
insert-size distribution and genome coverage, with or without generating a sam file.
As a result, it is useful in quality control of libraries and sequencing runs,
or evaluating new sequencing platforms. The derivative program BBSplit is also
useful in binning or refining metagenomic reads.

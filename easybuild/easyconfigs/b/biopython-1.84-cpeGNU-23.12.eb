Biopython is a set of freely available tools for biological computation written
in Python by an international team of developers. It is a distributed
collaborative effort to develop Python libraries and applications which address
the needs of current and future work in bioinformatics.

NOTE: This module is ONLY to be used as dependency of other modules. If you are
a user, you should use the module miniconda3 and create your own python environment
instead of loading this module.

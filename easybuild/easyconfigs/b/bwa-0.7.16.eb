description = """
BWA is a software package for mapping DNA sequences against a large
reference genome, such as the human genome. It consists of three algorithms:
BWA-backtrack, BWA-SW and BWA-MEM. The first algorithm is designed for Illumina
sequence reads up to 100bp, while the rest two for longer sequences ranged
from 70bp to a few megabases.

BWA-MEM and BWA-SW share similar features such as the support of long reads
and chimeric alignment, but BWA-MEM, which is the latest, is generally recommended
as it is faster and more accurate. BWA-MEM also has better performance than
BWA-backtrack for 70-100bp Illumina reads.

For all the algorithms, BWA first needs to construct the FM-index for the
reference genome (the index command). Alignment algorithms are invoked
with different sub-commands: aln/samse/sampe for BWA-backtrack,
bwasw for BWA-SW and mem for the BWA-MEM algorithm.

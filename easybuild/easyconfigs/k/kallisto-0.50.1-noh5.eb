description = """
kallisto is a program for quantifying abundances of transcripts from bulk and
single-cell RNA-Seq data, or more generally of target sequences using high-throughput
sequencing reads. It is based on the novel idea of pseudoalignment for rapidly
determining the compatibility of reads with targets, without the need for alignment.

On benchmarks with standard RNA-Seq data, kallisto can quantify 30 million human reads
in less than 3 minutes on a Mac desktop computer using only the read sequences and a
transcriptome index that itself takes less than 10 minutes to build. Pseudoalignment
of reads preserves the key information needed for quantification, and kallisto
is therefore not only fast, but also as accurate as existing quantification tools.
In fact, because the pseudoalignment procedure is robust to errors in the reads,
in many benchmarks kallisto significantly outperforms existing tools.

NOTE: This version of kallisto is compiled without HDF5 support.

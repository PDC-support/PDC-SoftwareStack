description = """
fastp is an ultra-fast FASTQ preprocessor with useful quality control and
data-filtering features. It can perform quality control, adapter trimming,
quality filtering, per-read quality pruning and many other operations with
a single scan of the FASTQ data. 

This tool is developed in C++ and has multi-threading support. Based on
our evaluation, fastp is 2â€“5 times faster than other FASTQ preprocessing
tools such as Trimmomatic or Cutadapt despite performing far more operations
than similar tools.

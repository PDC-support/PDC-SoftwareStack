]
description = """
SQLite is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained,
high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine. SQLite is the most used
database engine in the world. SQLite is built into all mobile phones and most
computers and comes bundled inside countless other applications that people
use every day. More Information...

The SQLite file format is stable, cross-platform, and backwards compatible and
the developers pledge to keep it that way through the year 2050. SQLite database f
iles are commonly used as containers to transfer rich content between systems
and as a long-term archival format for data. There are over 1 trillion (1e12)
SQLite databases in active use.

SQLite source code is in the public-domain and is free to everyone to use for
any purpose.

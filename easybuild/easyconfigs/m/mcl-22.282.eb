description = """
The MCL algorithm is short for the Markov Cluster Algorithm, a fast and scalable
unsupervised cluster algorithm for graphs (also known as networks) based on
simulation of (stochastic) flow in graphs. It has found usage in bioinformatics
and other disciplines. These pages contain descriptions, an animation, various
bits and pieces, and mcl software. The software scales to millions of nodes and
hundreds of millions of edges, running on a single machine and utilising multiple
CPUs. The software is widely used, part of various Linux distributions, and has
been stable for about a decade now. The mcl program comes with various network
loading, creation and manipulation companions, and development is focused on these.

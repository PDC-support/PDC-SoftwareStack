description = """
Contig Annotation Tool (CAT) and Bin Annotation Tool (BAT) are pipelines for
the taxonomic classification of long DNA sequences and metagenome assembled
genomes (MAGs / bins) of both known and (highly) unknown microorganisms, as
generated by contemporary metagenomics studies. The core algorithm of both
programs involves gene calling, mapping of predicted ORFs against a protein
database, and voting-based classification of the entire contig / MAG based
on classification of the individual ORFs. CAT and BAT can be run from
intermediate steps if files are formated appropriately.

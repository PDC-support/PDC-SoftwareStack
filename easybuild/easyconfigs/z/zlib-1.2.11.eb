description = """
zlib is designed to be a free, general-purpose, legally unencumbered -- that is,
not covered by any patents -- lossless data-compression library for use on
virtually any computer hardware and operating system. The zlib data format is
itself portable across platforms. Unlike the LZW compression method used in Unix
compress(1) and in the GIF image format, the compression method currently used
in zlib essentially never expands the data. (LZW can double or triple the file
size in extreme cases.) zlib's memory footprint is also independent of the input
data and can be reduced, if necessary, at some cost in compression.

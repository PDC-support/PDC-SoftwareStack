description = """
EAGLE is a method for evaluating the degree to which sequencing data supports a given
candidate genome variant. EAGLE incorporates candidate variants into explicit hypotheses
about the individualâ€™s genome, and then computes the probability of the observed data
(the sequencing reads) under each hypothesis. In comparison with methods which rely heavily
on a particular alignment of the reads to the reference genome, EAGLE readily accounts
for uncertainties that may arise from multi-mapping or local misalignment and uses
the entire length of each read.

NOTE: The unrelated, but the identically named software Eagle, used for haplotype phasing,
is available under the name haploeagle.

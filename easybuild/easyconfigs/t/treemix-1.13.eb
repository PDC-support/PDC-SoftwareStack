description = """
TreeMix is a method for inferring the patterns of population splits and mixtures
in the history of a set of populations. In the underlying model, the modern-day
populations in a species are related to a common ancestor via a graph of ancestral
populations. We use the allele frequencies in the modern populations to infer
the structure of this graph.

The details of the TreeMix model are presented in: Pickrell JK and Pritchard JK:
Inference of population splits and mixtures from genome-wide allele frequency data.

Some extensions are presented in: Pickrell JK, Patterson N, Barbieri C, Berthold F,
Gerlach L, GÃ¼ldemann T, Kure B, Mpoloka SW, Nakagawa H, Naumann C, Lipson M, Loh PR,
Lachance J, Mountain J, Bustamante CD, Berger B, Tishkoff SA, Henn BM, Stoneking M,

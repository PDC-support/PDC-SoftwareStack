description = """
trimAl is a tool for the automated removal of spurious sequences or poorly
aligned regions from a multiple sequence alignment.

trimAl can consider several parameters, alone or in multiple combinations,
in order to select the most-reliable positions in the alignment. These include
the proportion of sequences with a gap, the level of residue similarity and,
if several alignments for the same set of sequences are provided, the consistency
level of columns among alignments. Moreover, trimAl allows to manually select a
set of columns and sequences to be removed from the alignment.

trimAl implements a series of automated algorithms that trim the alignment
searching for optimum thresholds based on inherent characteristics of the input
alignment, to be used so that the signal-to-noise ratio after alignment trimming
phase is increased.

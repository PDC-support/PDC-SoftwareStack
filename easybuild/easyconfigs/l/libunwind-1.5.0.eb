description = """The primary goal of libunwind is to define a portable and
efficient C programming interface (API) to determine the call-chain of a
program. The API additionally provides the means to manipulate the preserved
(callee-saved) state of each call-frame and to resume execution at any point in
the call-chain (non-local goto). The API supports both local (same-process) and
remote (across-process) operation. As such, the API is useful in a number of
applications"""

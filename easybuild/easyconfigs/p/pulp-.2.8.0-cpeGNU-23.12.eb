PuLP is an LP modeler written in Python. PuLP can generate MPS or LP files and
call GLPK, COIN-OR CLP/CBC, CPLEX, GUROBI, MOSEK, XPRESS, CHOCO, MIPCL, SCIP to
solve linear problems.

This version of PuLP is installed without Cbc (COIN-OR Branch-and-Cut solver) support.

NOTE: This module is ONLY to be used as dependency of other modules. If you are
a user, you should use the module miniconda3 and create your own python environment
instead of loading this module.

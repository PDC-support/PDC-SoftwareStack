description = """
Porechop is a tool for finding and removing adapters from Oxford Nanopore reads.
Adapters on the ends of reads are trimmed off, and when a read has an adapter in
its middle, it is treated as chimeric and chopped into separate reads.
Porechop performs thorough alignments to effectively find adapters,
even at low sequence identity.

description = """
DendroPy is a Python library for phylogenetic computing. It provides classes and
functions for the simulation, processing, and manipulation of phylogenetic trees
and character matrices, and supports the reading and writing of phylogenetic data
in a range of formats, such as NEXUS, NEWICK, NeXML, Phylip, FASTA, etc. Application
scripts for performing some useful phylogenetic operations, such as data conversion
and tree posterior distribution summarization, are also distributed and installed
as part of the libary. DendroPy can thus function as a stand-alone library for
phylogenetics, a component of more complex multi-library phyloinformatic pipelines
or as a scripting "glue" that assembles and drives such pipelines.

NOTE: This module is ONLY to be used as dependency of other modules. If you are
a user, you should use the module miniconda3 and create your own python environment
instead of loading this module.

description = """
DIAMOND is a sequence aligner for protein and translated DNA searches, designed
for high performance analysis of big sequence data. The key features are:

* Pairwise alignment of proteins and translated DNA at 100x-10,000x speed of BLAST
* Protein clustering of up to tens of billions of proteins
* Frameshift alignments for long read analysis
* Low resource requirements and suitable for running on standard desktops or laptops
* Various output formats, including BLAST pairwise, tabular and XML, as well as taxonomic classification.
